#1 Eat-n-Split App

#3 About

I built this app as part of my react course for learning purposes. The app explores the topic of state, lifting up state and basic React.js syntax. 

The "Draft" folder is my own try at the project before watching the tutorials.

#3 How it works

The goal of the app is to help you split bills with friends and also keep track of the money owed to you or by you to other people. In the app, you can choose a friend, click the split button and introduce the bill value and your expense. The app will automatically calculate the owed amount. After that, you press the "save" button to split with the other person. 

Moreover, you can add a friend to the list by adding his name and picture. The picture url is connected to an API that generates random links to a database that stores pictures.
